# :sparkles: Med Andra Ord :sparkles:
This app is a mobile version of the popular game "Med Andra Ord". It's my first React Native project.

## Run game
To run the game you need react native installed.
```react-native run-ios```

## About
The game is played in two teams with at least two members in each team. One team starts by describing the word on the screen, but with *other* words. The other team members will try to guess the word on the screen.
